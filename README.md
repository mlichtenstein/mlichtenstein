My name is Max Lichtenstein.   

I recently graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz with a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  

My thesis project explored a variety of methods for reducing the overall energy consumption of tracking tags on large animals.   This was a fairly broad project.  Some of the highlights include:
* Building up an embedded system from scratch
* Designing and testing a variety of kinetic energy scavenging devices
* Building and controlling a pair of automated gantries to simulate animal motion
* Designing Kalman-filter based algorithms to perform energy-efficient sensor fusion of GPS and IMU data
* Developing an Android app to help test these algorithms
